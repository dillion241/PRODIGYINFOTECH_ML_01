# House Price Prediction Project

Predict house prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. Explore the relationship between key features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage) and house prices to gain insights into real estate market trends.

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on important features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. By analyzing and modeling this data, we aim to uncover patterns in the housing market and provide accurate price predictions for potential buyers and sellers.

## Features

- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Implementing Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression models
- Evaluating model performance using RMSE
- Exploring the impact of different regularization strengths

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset sourced from [Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). The dataset contains essential information about houses and their corresponding prices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

3. Install required dependencies:

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the project directory.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb` to analyze, preprocess, and model the data.

3. Modify the alpha values for Lasso and Ridge regression to experiment with different regularization strengths.

4. Observe the RMSE values for each model and compare their performance.

## Results
The project results include the evaluation of Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression models in predicting house prices. The RMSE values provide insights into the models' accuracy, and model comparisons help identify the best-performing approach.
